# 1U_Attenuverter
1U Attenuverter or passive attenuator

Practical 6hp 1U utility module that can be built in 3 different configurations
1. Passive attenuator >> only use front panel + controls pcb
2. Attenuverter with 5V voltage reference connected to the switch in the input jack. If nothing is plugged in, you will have +/- 5V to use as offset.
3. Attenuverter without voltage reference. If you don't need this functionality you can save yourself ~$0.50 worth of parts.


Since this is a free DIY project, I'm not able to offer a whole lot of support. 
I've built all of them myself and can confirm that they're working as I intended.
